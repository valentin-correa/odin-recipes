        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a quarter cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (4 to 6 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup rice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>half a teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken stock, or as needed to cover</li>
            <li>1 cup green peas</li>
            <li>half a cup of sliced black olives</li>
            <li>half a cup of raisins</li>
            <li>a quarter of a cup of chopped pimento peppers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir chicken pieces until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a plate. Cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, minced garlic, and whole garlic cloves in the same Dutch oven until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return chicken to the onion mixture. Add tomatoes, rice, salt, oregano, black pepper, and bay leaf. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken-rice mixture in the preheated oven until rice is tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir peas, olives, raisins, and pimento peppers into the chicken-rice mixture. Bake until warmed through, an additional 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
