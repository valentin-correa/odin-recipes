        <p>These braised short ribs are pretty much foolproof. As long as two things happen, you are in for some very fine eats. First, the beef must be really well browned â€” I'm talking deep, dark, crusty, and caramelized. The other key step is easier. Just braise them until they're fork-tender. To paraphrase an expression, 'stick a fork in them, they're done.' After browning properly, the only way to mess these up is to undercook them, so don't.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into half-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 and a half poundes of beef short Ribs</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 quart beef broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer crisped bacon with a slotted spoon to a Dutch oven. Keep bacon drippings in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat bacon drippings in the skillet over high heat. Cook short ribs in hot drippings until browned and caramelized on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to a Dutch oven, reserving drippings in the skillet. Add thyme and bay leaf to the Dutch oven. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the skillet until soft and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour into onion mixture and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour sherry into onion mixture; cook until thick and hot, about 2 minutes. Pour onion-sherry mixture into the Dutch oven; pour in beef broth and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cover the Dutch oven with a lid.</li>
            <li>Transfer the Dutch oven to the preheated oven and cook until short ribs are fork-tender, about 2 hours. Remove ribs to a serving dish, reserving sauce in the pot.</li>
            <li>Set Dutch oven over high heat and boil sauce until reduced and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Spoon reduced sauce over ribs.</li>
        </ol>
